You are requested to build a React application to display sculpture details. The application should have the following components:

1.Title of the sculpture.

2.Image of the sculpture.

3.Artist name.

4.Description.

5.A switch button to select dark and light themes.

6.Four navigation buttons: The previous and next buttons move back and forth between the sculpture details, and the first and last buttons reach the first and last records.

Note: Use React-Bootstrap for styling. The sculpture details are available in the ‘data.js’ file.

App will run on the port:  http://localhost:3000

Here is the output for both light and dark themes.
